The project focuses on leveraging optimized stacked ensemble techniques for the prediction of cervical cancer. Specifically, it integrates Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) with Recursive Feature Elimination with Random Forest (RFERF) to enhance the predictive accuracy. By employing a stacked ensemble approach, the model harnesses the strengths of multiple algorithms to mitigate bias and variance, thereby improving overall performance. This research aims to contribute to more accurate and reliable methods for cervical cancer prediction, which could potentially aid in early detection and intervention efforts.
